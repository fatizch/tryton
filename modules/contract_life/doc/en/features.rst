- **Coverage amount selection**: When subscribing a life contract, we need to be
  able to chose the amount up to which the covered element will be insured for.
  This is typically used to chose a *death capital* or a *daily payment* amount
  for the contract.

- **Coverage typing**: Add life related insurance kinds on coverages: death,
  temporary disability, disability (partial, total), complete and irreversible
  loss of autonomy, annuities (education, joint).
