- **Generation of documents :** Allow the generation of documents and 
  attach them to a contract / set of contracts from a process on a contract set,
  for example, during a transition between steps.

- **Subpocess on contracts :** A process on a set of contracts can include
  subprocesses for each contract in the set. It is, for example, possible to
  start, from a contract set process, a subprocess which validates each contract in
  a contract set. Once each contract is validated, and this each subprocess has
  finished, the main process activates each contract simultaneously.
