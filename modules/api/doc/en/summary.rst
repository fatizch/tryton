This module adds a framework for adding new, extensible business APIs,
dedicated to communicating with other systems.

Compared to existing APIs (all low-level RPC calls available), they provide:

- Separated, per-API access rights
- Specific error management, with data rather than text as return values
- Input / output validation mechanism
- Auto-generated description API
