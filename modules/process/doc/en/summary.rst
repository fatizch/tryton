This module allows the creation of configurable processes directly 
in the application. It avoids imposiing a format for specific business data.
To subscribe to a contract, for example the process can vary depending
on the internal workflow of the company, the type of business, even
the product. To meet this need, this modules allows the creation and 
customisation of business processes via an interface:

  - The order in which data is inputted

  - The controls to applied (and when they should be applied)

  - The design of each window

  - The authorizations on each screen
