- **Underwriting types**: It is possible to configure underwriting types, as
  well as decision types. The underwriting type is used to define what kind of
  decisions will be available, as well as the provisional decision to apply
  while the underwriting is in progress.

- **Underwriting**: It is possible to create underwritings which, according
  to the selected type, will manage a list of decisions. Each decision can be
  individually validated or abandoned, and the underwriting can be completed
  "as a whole".

- **Underwriting planning**: The current underwriting can be copied in the
  future to plan future decisions.
