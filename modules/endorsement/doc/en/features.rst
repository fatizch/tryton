- **Endorsement configuration :** It is possible to create endorsements by
  combining basic endorsements on the interface. These endorsements can be
  attached to products, or be available no matter what the product is.

- **Entry suspension :** An endorsement's entry can be done in many times
  without loss. Changes in the endorsement are saved without impacting the
  contract. A suspended endorsement can be recovered any time.

- **Endorsement cancellation :** An applied endorsement can be cancelled under
  certain conditions. This cancellation re-established the contract's state
  before applying the endorsement.

- **Endorsement synthesis :** It is possible to consult the changes brought by
  the endorsement before and after applying it as a text synthesis.

- **Endorsement preview :** After entry (and before appliance), it is possible
  to display a before / after screen which shows changes made by an endorsment,
  in terms of a contract's premiums for example.

- **Options management endorsement :** Allows to handle options after
  subscribing to a contract. It includes new options subscription, existing
  options termination, and extra data changes on current options.

- **Developer tools :** A tools set is available to make writing endorsements
  easier

- **Report templates :** Allows to configure report templates to generate when
  applying or cancelling an endorsement in endorsement models. To be generated,
  the template must be referenced from the event type and the concerned product.
