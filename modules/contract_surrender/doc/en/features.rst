- **Contract Surrender**: Coverages may be configured to allow contract
  surrenders. If a contract has one or more coverages that allows it, it will
  be possible to surrender it, which amounts to a termination with a surrender
  payment to the subscriber. The value of the payment is computed according to
  the configured rules on the coverages

- **Surrender Eligibility**: Along the surrender rule, it is possible to define
  another rule that will be used to compute whether surrender is possible for
  the contract

- **Automated Surrender**: Coverages may be configured to automatically surrend
  the contract rather than terminate it when a termination should be done
