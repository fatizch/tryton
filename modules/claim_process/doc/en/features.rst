- **Claim processes**: Configure processes for claim creations and processing.
  This allows maximum customization in terms of views / workflow. When creating
  a new claim, it is possible to resume an existing claim matching the given
  parameters (claimant, type, etc...). The wizard also provides a shortcut to
  close existing claims

- **Per loss processes**: Processes can be linked to specific loss
  descriptions. The reason is that usually the process for a capital based
  indemnification and annuities will not be the same. So depending on the kind
  of event the processes will be filtered ton only use the most appropriate
  one
