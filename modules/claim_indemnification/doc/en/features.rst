- **Indemnification calculation**: An indemnification rule can be configured on
  a benefit. This rule will allow to automatically compute the indemnification
  amounts depending ont the characteristics of the contract and the event that
  triggered the indemnification

- **Indemnification types**: When configuring a benefit, it is possible to
  choose if the indemnification will be a capital, a periodic indemnification
  (depending on variable inputs), or annuities. Each of those types will be
  handled through an appropriate process

- **Revaluation**: Revaluation rules can be defined along indemnification
  rules. They will be used to revaluate the base amounts, in order to separate
  the final amount elements

- **Deductible**: If a deductible rule is defined, the start date of the
  indemnification (for annuities or periodic indemnifications) will be delayed
  up to the computed deductible date
