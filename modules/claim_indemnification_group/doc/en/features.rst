- **Benefit rules configuration**: It is possible to select multiple benefit
  rules which will be available when subscribing the contract. If this is the
  case, the contract's subscriber will be able to chose the rule he wants to
  use.
  It is still possible to force the use of a given rule through the
  configuration. For instance, one can decide to force the deductible rule,
  while letting the subscriber chose the indemnification rule.

- **Subscription selection of benefit rules**: When subscribing a contract, for
  each selected coverage, the list of related benefits will be displayed with
  their associated rules. The user can then chose the rules (and their
  parameters if applicable) depending on the subscriber's choices.

- **Claim services transferring**: When transferring a group contract to a
  different product, we want to automatically create new delivered services for
  existing claims. It is possible to select for each option / benefit tuple on
  the source contract the associated data on the new contract.
