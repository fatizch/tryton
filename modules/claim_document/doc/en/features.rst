- **Configure required documents**: requested documents are configured
  at the loss and benefit descriptions.

- **Manage documents on a claim**: During the declaration of a claim,
  this module calculates the necessary documents, informs the reception of
  documents, and generate a mail in the case of missing documents.

- **Automatic reminder of required documents for claims**: Each requested
  document can be configured to define a maximum number of reminders or stay empty
  in the case of unlimited reminders. The absence of configuration concering the
  delay of reminders deactivates automatic claim reminders and associated documents
  in loss desciptions.
