- **Extra details configuration**: Every coverage can have a rule which will
  return extra details values for the associated subscribed coverages. Those
  details can be calculated as needed from the contract

- **Extra details current value**: The option includes a "current details"
  field which is computed on the fly for all extra details for an easier and
  up to date access to the information. It is possible to filter out some
  values which are deemed too technical by setting the "hidden details" field
  on the coverage
