- **Manage beneficiary**: Coog allows to track actions taken to find
beneficiaries. Once the beneficiary is identified, Coog generates document 
requests based on interest configuration and tracks their reception.

- **Treatment delay management**: Eckert law requires delay to treat a claim:
delay to request document once beneficairy is known, delay to pay benefits once 
all documents are received. Coog integrates this requirement in the claim 
treatment processs

- **Manage benefit calculation based on interest rate and penalty**: Coog 
handles the interest computation from the death date to the benefit payment. 
Also if the delay is over, Coog will calculate penalty according to 
configuration.
