- **Per party accounting analysis**: The "Party Balance" entry point on parties
  displays the accounting lines related to the party. There are various filters
  available to hide / show lines (typically, exclude reconciled lines,
  cancelled invoices, etc.)

- **Line grouping**: Some lines may be grouped for better understanding. For
  instance, statement lines can be grouped using this feature in order to
  precisely understand where does the money comes from.

- **Contract analysis**: It is possible to filter contract per contract, in
  order to provide a more detailed analysis level.
