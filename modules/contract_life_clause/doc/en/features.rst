- **Beneficiary clause selection :** This module makes the beneficiary clause
  selection mandatory for options which require it. The clause must be defined
  during the subscription. There is a default value for the clause depending
  on the option's settings.

- **Customizable clauses :** If the set up allows it, it is possible to change
  the beneficiary clause's content during the subscription. This change belongs
  to the option on which the clause is defined.

- **Beneficiaries list :** It is possible to enter a beneficiaries list
  nominatively on a contract. It is then possible to tie each list element to a
  percentage representing the benefit part which will be returned to him.

- **Accepting beneficiary :** A beneficiary can be tagged as *Accepting*, in
  which case he will be informed of all the modifications made to the contract.
