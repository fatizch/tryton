- **Block an actor's payments**
    It is possible to block all payments that have been made to a certain actor.
    The debt is recorded (negative amount on the account), but as long as the account
    is blocked no payment can be generated. This is useful if the actor uses automatic
    payments and the account requires a temporary suspensions of payments.
