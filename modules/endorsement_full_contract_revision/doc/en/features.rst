- **Full contract revision endorsement**: Converts the contract back to a quote
  while the endorsement lasts. Modification are actually done on the contract,
  which is less clean than on an actual endorsement (where nothing is effective
  until the endorsement is applied). This in place allows for a better
  readability in the process. It is possible to cancel everything at any time
