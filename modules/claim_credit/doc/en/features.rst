- **Loan related data**: If a service is linked to a "loan" option, a loan
  will be associated to it. Doing so will make loan data (as well as the
  associated share) available in the rule engine when calculating
  indemnification amounts or eligibility

- **Automatic service data**: On loan related services, the end date and
  periodicty can be automatically calculated from the loan data
