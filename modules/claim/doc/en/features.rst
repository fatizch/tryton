- **Insurer delegation management**: It is possible to configure, on an
  insurer / insurance kind basis the different delegation levels for the
  company. For claims, that includes : claim creation, creating / paying
  indemnifications, etc...

- **Duplicate handling**: When validating claim losses, a warning will be
  diplayed to the user if similar losses (same date, loss description, covered
  person...) are found in the database.
