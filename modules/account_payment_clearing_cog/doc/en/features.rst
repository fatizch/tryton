- **Auto post clearing move**: A configuration option on the journal allows to
  automatically post clearing move as they are created.

- **Always create clearing moves**: When a payment is rejected without ever
  being approved, the default behavior does not create any clearing move.
  Enabling this option on the journal will create both the clearing move and
  its cancellation for a better audit trail.
