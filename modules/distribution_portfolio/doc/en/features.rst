- **Handle client portfolios**: The client's referencial can be partitioned into
 many client portfolios. It is materialized by a distribution network to which
 we give the "Client Portfolio" property.
 Each party created on the application belongs to a portfolio. It can be used by
 all portfolio childen distribution networks.
 The default distribution network of a party is the one affected to the user
 who creates it. If there is no such information, the distribution network to
 use is the one in the party's configuration.
