- **Secondary service computation**: Services that complement other services
  (for instance, separate revaluation, or bonus services...) are calculated
  synchronously when the base service is. The computed data from the base
  service are available in the rule engine so as to know how much will already
  be paid in case it is necessary to compute the secondary amount.
