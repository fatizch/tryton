- **One-click printing / mailing**: The application interface allows the user
  to directly choose what to do with the document which is going to be
  generated.

- **Event based document generation**: Configure inside the application the
  events which should trigger an automatic document generation. It is possible
  to select where the generated document should be placed on the server
  filesystem.

- **Pdf conversion**: The configuration allows to choose whether or not the
  document should be converted to pdf or keep its original format.

- **Internal EDM linking**: Generated documents can be configured to be stored
  in the internal EDM. The storage format can be configured and may be
  different than the one received by the user.

- **Split or group documents**: When printing a group of documents, it is
  possible to choose between one grouped file, or multiple files.

- **Asynchronous document requests**: Event triggered document generations can
  be configured for synchronous or asynchronouse behaviour. While synchronous
  documents are generated right after the event occured, asynchronous documents
  are stores as "document requests" that are planned in the future. Those 
  requests can be automatically processed with a batch, or manually with a
  dedicated wizard.
