- **Automatic process selection**: Depending ont the contract main
  characteristics (product, effective date...), the best available process is
  selected to be used for data input. Additional fields are available to
  further customize the process according to the product's requirements

- **Notification process**: Contract notifications are made processable, which
  makes it easier to trigger actions requiring custom views on certain events.
  It also allows to bypass the fact that contracts can only have one active
  process at a time
