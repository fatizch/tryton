- **Setting the eligibility rule**: Via the rule engine, it's possible to define
 its own eligibility rules for a delivered service (ex: time limit, payments of 
 up-to-date receipts, ...)

- **Claim eligibility management at the level of loss**: Eligibility is 
automatically calculated according to defined rules. It's possible to force 
validation (in case of late declaration, ...) or to reject it while the study 
is in progress
